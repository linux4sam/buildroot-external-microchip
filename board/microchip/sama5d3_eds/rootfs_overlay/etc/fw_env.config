# Configuration file for fw_(printenv/setenv) utility.
# Up to two entries are valid, in this case the redundant
# environment sector is assumed present.
# Notice, that the "Number of sectors" is not required on NOR and SPI-dataflash.
# Furthermore, if the Flash sector size is omitted, this value is assumed to
# be the same as the Environment size, which is valid for NOR and SPI-dataflash

# NAND example
# MTD device name	Device offset	Env. size	Flash sector size	Number of sectors
/dev/mtd2		0x0000		0x20000		0x20000			1
/dev/mtd3		0x0000		0x20000		0x20000			1

# VFAT example
#/boot/uboot.env	0x0000          0x4000
