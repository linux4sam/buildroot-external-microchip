          Control agents are a proxy in which a CAPI control command is converted for the device into the deviceâ€™s native control interface. 
	  APs, DUTs, sniffers, and STAs may require control agents. 
	  Sample control agent code can be downloaded through the open source repository ( Windows or Linux ) or by members in the most recent Wi-Fi Test Suite package .
